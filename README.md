# 🧩 Django Portfolio Guide

An interactive roadmap to help aspiring Django developers strategically plan, build, and showcase real-world projects.

## 📌 Overview

This project is a visual and interactive guide designed to help Django learners build a **strong, skill-based portfolio** through well-structured project suggestions. It includes project complexity levels, estimated timeframes, required skills, and learning outcomes — all visualized through charts and filters.

The idea began as a personal guide to structure my own Django learning journey. After researching various platforms, resources, and community insights, I realized that many learners — especially those learning independently — struggle to find a clear path from beginner to advanced Django projects. So, I built this tool not only for myself, but also to **support others who are learning Django on their own**.
